To finish the install of mod_sflow, you need
to enable the module by adding the following line
to your /etc/apache2/httpd2.conf file:

  LoadModule sflow_module ${PREFIX}/lib/apache2/mod_sflow.so

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl2 restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.
