To finish the install of mod_sflow, you need
to enable the module by adding the following line
to your /etc/apache2/httpd2.conf file:

  LoadModule sflow_module ${PREFIX}/lib/apache2/mod_sflow.so

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl2 restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.

Additionally, exporting sFlow data to your desired collector
requires you to set up an appropriate ${SYSCONFDIR}/hsflowd.auto
file with sampling/polling settings.

The ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/apache2/mod/mod_sflow/ directory
contains a basic example, as well as additional configuration
hints in the README.
