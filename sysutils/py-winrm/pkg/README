Authentication types
====================

${PKGSTEM} supports several authentication types:
  - Basic
  - NTLM
  - Kerberos
  - CredSSP

The ${PKGSTEM} package supports only the Basic and NTLM as authentication
types, to limit the number of external dependencies. Enabling the other
types is a simple matter of installing the relevant Python modules.


Kerberos
--------
You can add Kerberos support by also installing the 'requests-kerberos'
module, available as port/package 'www/py-requests-kerberos'.

Note that this also requires setting up the appropriate Kerberos
infrastructure on your host. The 'requests-kerberos' module ensures that
the required dependencies are also installed. For further instructions,
see e.g. krb5.conf(5).


CredSSP
-------
You can add CredSSP support by also installing the 'requests-credssp'
module, available as port/package 'www/py-requests-credssp'.
