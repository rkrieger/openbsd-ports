The mdata-client tools allow Triton/SmartOS guests to access and
manipulate metadata key-value pairs available from the hypervisor.

This mechanism allows for setting hostnames, retrieving provisioning
scripts or communicating other data, such as public ssh keys.

The tools use the Joyent Metadata Protocol version 2 over the second
serial device (/dev/cua01).
